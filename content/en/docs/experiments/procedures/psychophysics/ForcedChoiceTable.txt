| Forced Yes/No              | Manual    | In the forced yes/no task, the stimulus is first presented to the subject, along with a cue that prompts the subject to attend to it. <br /><br /> Then a probe image is presented to the subject, with instructions to answer Yes or No to a stimulus quality; for example, if one or two stimuli could be felt, the subject presses one button for Yes and another for No. The task will wait indefinitely until the subject has answered the question. <br /><br /> This task is usually used for stimuli that are always felt but whose quality changes with increasing intensity. Examples of such stimuli are two-point stimuli or stimuli used to determine a just noticeable difference. | None |
