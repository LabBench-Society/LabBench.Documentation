The purpose of this getting started guide is to demonstrate how to run an experiment that studies the relationship between Depression, Anxiety and Stress, and response inhibition.

 Depression, Anxiety and Stress is assessed with the DASS scale from the Psychology Foundation of Australia []. The DASS scale measures three related emotional states of depression, anxiety, and stress on 42-item self-report questionnaire. 

Response inhibition is assessed with the use of a gamified version of the Stop-Signal Task. The classical Stop-Signal Task measures the ability to supress actions that are no longer required or appropriate. In the Stop-Signal Task participants are asked to perform a Go task that at random and infrequent times are interrupted by a Stop-Signal. Without a Stop-Signal the subjects see a Go signal of a left or right arrow and must press the left or right button respectively. In these Go-trials, not pressing a button is an error and the goal is to press the correct right or left button as fast as possible. However, when a Stop-Signal is presented with a delay after the Go-Signal, the participant must inhibit their response, and in these trials pressing a button is an error. The delay between the Go and Stop signals is adjusted throughout the test to find the minimal delay at which the participants can inhibit their response.

In the classical Stop-Signal Task the participants are told whether they responded correctly or incorrectly after each trial. However, in the present protocol the Stop-Signal Task has been turned into a game to demonstrate the capabilities of LabBench for dynamically generating visual stimuli. In this version the participants are awarded points depending on how fast and how many times they answer correctly on Go signals. However, if they fail to inhibit their response in Stop trials the additional points, they are answered for multiple correct Go trials answers are reset.

This getting started guide will explain how to setup, run, and analyse data from this experiment. This explanation will provide an overview of all the key concepts that needs to be known before you can use LabBench for your studies within neuroscience.
